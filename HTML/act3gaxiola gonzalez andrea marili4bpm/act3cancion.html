    <h1>Circles</h1>
    <div class="contletra">
    <p class="p1">We couldn't turn around <br>
    'Til we were upside down<br>
    I'll be the bad guy now<br>
    But, no, I ain't too proud<br></p>
    <p class="p2">I couldn't be there<br>
    Even when I tried<br>
    You don't believe it<br>
    We do this every time<br></p>
    <p class="p3">Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
    Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away<br></p>
    <p class="4">I dare you to do something<br>
    I'm waiting on you again<br>
    So I don't take the blame<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away, run away<br></p>
    <p class="5">Let go<br>
    I got a feeling that it's time to let go<br></p>
    <p class="6">I say so<br>
    I knew that this was doomed from the get-go<br></p>
    <p class="7">You thought that it was special, special<br>
    But it was just the sex though, the sex though<br>
    And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)<br>
    I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go<br></p>
    <p class="8">Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
    Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away<br></p>
    <p class="9">I dare you to do something<br>
    I'm waiting on you again<br>
    So I don't take the blame<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away, run away<br></p>
    <p class="10">Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through<br>
    It's only me<br>
    What you got to lose?<br>
    Make up your mind, tell me<br>
    What are you gonna do?<br>
    It's only me<br>
    Let it go<br></p>
    <p class="11">Seasons change and our love went cold<br>
    Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away<br></p>
    <p class="12">I dare you to do something<br>
    I'm waiting on you again<br>
    So I don't take the blame<br>
    Run away, but we're running in circles<br>
    Run away, run away, run away<br></p>
